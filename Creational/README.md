## Creational patterns

Creation patterns are divided into two types:

1. Class Level Patterns
2. Object level patterns.

Class-level patterns change the class of the created object using inheritance.

Object level patterns create new objects using other objects.

Only "Factory Method" applies to class-level patterns.

Creation patterns are responsible for creating classes and objects. In other words, generate classes and generate objects.

* [Abstract Factory](AbstractFactory)
* [Builder (Builder)](Builder)
* [Factory Method](FactoryMethod)
* [Prototype (Prototype)](Prototype)
* [Singleton](Singleton)
